              Journal of Modern Slavery: A Multidisciplinary Exploration of
              Human Trafficking Solutions is a peer-reviewed scholarly journal
              dedicated to research, theory and practical application in
              eradicating slavery. It is a nexus of critical thought for all
              fields relating to understanding and combating modern slavery and
              is unique in its focus on the issues of slavery and human
              trafficking. Journal of Modern Slavery engages academics and
              practitioners in dialogue between the fields, helping us find
              common language and working toward our common goal. The Journal
              will include relevant research papers, review papers, case studies
              and conference reports. Journal of Modern Slavery serves as an
              appropriate outlet for articles of interest to its broad audience
              of scholars and professionals as well as specialists within each
              field. Manuscripts that use academic rigor to better understand
              any topic of relevance to slavery/human trafficking are
              appropriate for submission. Of special interest are studies aiming
              at the investigation of causal relationships.
