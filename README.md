# Slave Free Today 

## Project #4: Final Project (UX/WD Collab Group Variant)

## Overview

*   Journal of Modern Slavery: A Multidisciplinary Exploration of Human Trafficking Solutions is dedicated to research, theory, and practical application in eradicating slavery. It is a nexus of critical thought for all fields relating to understanding and combating modern slavery and is unique in its focus on the issues of slavery and human trafficking.

*   Our journal was born with the name Slavery Today Journal in February 2014 (that’s why you’ll see that title on older issues). We recently made the decision to offer our issues FREE of CHARGE, and to publish individual articles as they are completed, rather than wait to fill an issue with several articles and then publish. We feel this will produce more timely information to support those working in our dynamic, rapidly-changing field.

## Future Development

In the future, we as the DEV team would like to make our website function and look exactly like how the UX team had laid out on the wireframe.  Most Importantly the functionality of the website would need to go from "Most Valuable Product" to a app that contains all the functionablity that was displayed on the wireframe.

The functionality that would need to be completed in the future would include:

    * Search Bar that filters through not only the article contents, but user accounts, and multimedia as well.

    * Multimedia page that contains a section for 

        - Podcasts
        - Blog
        - Books
        - Videos

    * Authentication, this website should have two tier user access system.
        tier 1 user = these users are only able to view the contents.
        tier 2 user = these users are able to contribute articles that will be used as contents for the page.

    * Fully functioning Calender that displays on to the page and where the user tier2* can add events to the calender as well.
